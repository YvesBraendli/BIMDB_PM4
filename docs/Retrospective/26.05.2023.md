# Retrospective 26.05.2023

## What worked well?
- Pragmatic collaboration: Clear responsibilities reduced interface complexity within the team. Team meetings focused on relevant topics for everyone, while specific issues concerning certain team members or responsibilities were addressed individually.
- Features for the demo finished with sufficient time for refactoring and testing.

## What could be improved?
- Potential for communication quality improvement: Biweekly standup calls would be beneficial in a professional environment.
- Motivating coding development highlights: Having a channel for sharing coding development highlights would inspire the entire team for long-term growth.
- Earlier and frequent documentation: Workflows for documenting and refactoring the project documentation.

## What will we commit to improve?
- Finalize documentation: As the project has come to an end, we will focus on finalizing a sophisticated and complete documentation.
