## Context and Problem Statement
The basic situation was to find a database, which holds all required information about movies, that we needed
for our project.

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->
## Decision Drivers

* Database should be free to use
* There shouldn't be a rate limitation to the database
* The Database should be accessible over an API interface
* The Database should be easy to work with

## Considered Options

* IMDB
* TMDB

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "TMDB", because it  fulfills all the required decision drivers, and after it  is easier to use and to
get an API-key, than from the IMDB framework.
