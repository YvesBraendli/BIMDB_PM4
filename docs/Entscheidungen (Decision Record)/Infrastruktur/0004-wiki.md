## Context and Problem Statement

We need to evaluate and choose the most suitable approach for creating software documentation. The options considered are using Word, GitLab's built-in Wiki, and static site generation using MKDocs.

## Decision Drivers

- Need for professional-looking software documentation.
- Collaboration and ease of use.
- Version control and tracking changes.
- Ability to generate a static site for hosting and sharing documentation.

## Considered Options

- Word document.
- GitLab's built-in Wiki.
- Static site generation using MKDocs.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Static site generation using MKDocs. This approach provides a professional-looking documentation solution, supports collaboration and version control, and enables the generation of a static site for easy hosting and sharing.

### Consequences

- Good, because static site generation using MKDocs allows for a consistent and visually appealing documentation format.
- Good, because it promotes collaboration and version control through GitLab's versioning capabilities.
- Good, because the generated static site can be easily hosted and shared with stakeholders.
- Bad, because using MKDocs may require some initial setup and configuration.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Word Document

- Good, because Word provides a familiar and widely-used tool for document creation.
- Good, because it offers advanced formatting features and layout customization.
- Bad, because collaborating and tracking changes in Word documents can be challenging.
- Bad, because hosting and sharing Word documents may require additional steps and tools.

### GitLab's Built-in Wiki

- Good, because it is integrated within the GitLab platform, making it easily accessible for collaboration.
- Good, because it supports version control and tracking changes.
- Bad, because the formatting and layout options may be limited compared to other tools.
- Bad, because hosting and sharing the Wiki may be specific to the GitLab platform.

### Static Site Generation using MKDocs

- Good, because MKDocs utilizes Markdown syntax, making it easy to write and format documentation.
- Good, because it provides a visually appealing and consistent documentation format.
- Good, because the generated static site can be easily hosted and shared through various platforms.
- Bad, because configuring MKDocs may require some initial setup and learning.
