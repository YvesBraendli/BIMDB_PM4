## Context and Problem Statement

We need to decide on the approach for bundling our application, including the frontend and backend components. The options considered are using Docker images with fixed manifests and using Helm Charts with templating for different environments.

## Decision Drivers

- Simplified deployment and management of the application.
- Flexibility in managing configuration and environment-specific settings.
- Reusability and scalability of deployment artifacts.

## Considered Options

- Docker images with fixed manifests.
- Helm Charts with templating.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Helm Charts with templating. This approach provides a more flexible and scalable solution for bundling and deploying our application.

### Consequences

- Good, because Helm Charts allow for the management of configuration and environment-specific settings through templating.
- Good, because Helm Charts provide a higher level of abstraction and reusability, making it easier to manage and deploy the application across different environments.
- Bad, because utilizing Helm Charts may require some learning and initial setup.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Docker Images with Fixed Manifests

- Good, because using Docker images allows for containerization and consistent deployment of the application.
- Good, because fixed manifests provide a straightforward deployment configuration.
- Bad, because managing environment-specific settings and configurations may require additional effort and manual changes.
- Bad, because maintaining and updating fixed manifests for different environments can become cumbersome.

### Helm Charts with Templating

- Good, because Helm Charts provide a higher level of abstraction and modularity for deploying the application.
- Good, because templating enables the management of configuration and environment-specific settings more efficiently.
- Bad, because utilizing Helm Charts may require some initial setup and learning.
- Bad, because complex or customized deployments may require additional customization of Helm Charts.

## Additional Information

Secret Managment will be handled over CI-Variables and deployed as `Kubernetes Secrets`.
